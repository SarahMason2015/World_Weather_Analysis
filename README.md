# World_Weather_Analysis

The tools provided in this repository will give a person a choice on where they would like to vacation based on their temperature preferences. In this module we pulled information from thousands of locations. Information from each location included, but not limited to; temp, current weather, city, and location (lat/lng). A mapping feature was also added in the end, to see what route would be best, along with potential hotel accommodations.
